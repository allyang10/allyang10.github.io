<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Hello, I am a current undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Michigan. I'm proficient in c++, python,
    java, github, html, css, and lua. I'm currently working as a private coding instructor for CodaKid, teaching a large range of students
    python, lua, scratch, and java. 
<br><br>
    In my free time I enjoy artistic swimming, reading a good book, doing my nails, and experimenting with various art forms
    including polymer clay, needle felting, sketching, and oil painting!
<br><br>
    I'm currently looking for a summer 2025 software engineering internship. Please feel free to contact me
    about any opportunities!
</h3>
